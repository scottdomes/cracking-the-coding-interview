# Description

Going through Cracking the Coding interview and solving each challenge, but using languages I'm less comfortable with.

See the language breakdown on the righthand side of the Github view. Here's how much I knew of each language, before starting:

Ruby: lots

Python: a fair bit

Java: a little

Swift: a little

Go: nothing

Rust: nothing

My feelings so far on the newer languages:

Go: 🤩

Rust: 😅

Swift: 😍

Java: 💩
